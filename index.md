# WoW-Raid-Tracker
This repository is a comprehensive raid tracker addon for World of Warcraft that is meant to be ran and implemented in Google Sheets. This program automatically populates data from several different API's including the following:
* World of Warcraft Character Data API's 
* Raider.io API's 
* WarcraftLogs API's 

Once data in the spreadsheet is populated the statistics panel on the right will display key information on your raid group such as the group composition, armor type, covenant information and more. In addition to automatically populating the spreadsheet, this addon offers many more features including the ability to programmatically create charts in the Create Charts spreadsheet in order to view charts on your raid teams performance and all of the raid teams in your guilds performance. Through the use of the Spreadsheet Updater menu you can choose to update data in the spreadsheet whenever you like, but triggers are also set up to update the spreadsheet automatically every day at 12am Pacific Standard Time (PST). These triggers also upload data to the the database and update the All Data spreadsheet so data will be updated after each day.
